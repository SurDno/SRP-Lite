[LUA][ERROR] ERROR: Unable to give treasure [gar_treasure_quest_smuggler_weapons] because inventory box is already in use by treasure [gar_treasure_quest_smuggler_weapons]. - Decane

### General fixes:
- Fixed the storyline breaking if the player does not respond to the SOS signal in the Red Forest before speaking with Forester. - Decane
- Fixed the issue where the Freedom base gate would open upon completion of the "Deliver ammo to the outpost" task instead of only after the player has found the active PDA on the dead blockpost commander's corpse, enabling the player to speak to Chekhov prematurely and break the storyline. - Decane
- Fixed the storyline temporarily breaking if the player suppresses the Limansk military machine gun nest during the interval between receiving and completing the task to speak to the Clear Sky squad commander. - Decane
- Fixed the level changers to the Cordon not becoming unlocked when the player first travels there from the Great Swamps if Clear Sky loses their victory over the renegades during the player's pre-travel conversation with the guide, resulting in the player getting locked into the Swamps upon first returning there if Clear Sky has not by then regained victory over the renegades. - Decane
- Fixed the issue where loading a savegame would make the game copy offered but unassigned combat tasks to a Lua table intended only for assigned combat tasks, causing various bugs ranging from stuck faction wars to the robbery scheme ceasing to activate. - Decane
- Fixed eight stash coordinates being unattainable from the following characters due to programming mistakes: Drifter (1), General Krylov (2), Hermit (1), Hound (1), Kolobok (1), Mitay (1), Semyon Lambee (1). Notably, Drifter now offers coordinates to a stash containing the third Cordon flash drive if the player saves him from dogs. - Decane
- Fixed the script bugs responsible for Drifter and Hound dying upon switching online from an offline state following completion of the tasks to escort them to safety. - Decane
- Fixed the issue where the dogs spawned for Wolf's "Help the stalker" task might never attack Drifter if the player picks up Sidorovich's loot before taking the task. - Decane
- Fixed Clear Sky's "Find a way to Chernobyl NPP" task not completing. - Decane
- Fixed Clear Sky's "Find generator" task not completing when the player deactivates the generator in Limansk if the task is still active then. - Decane
- Fixed Clear Sky's "Return to the group commander" task not cancelling when the player deactivates the generator in Limansk if the task is still active then. - Decane
- Fixed Clear Sky's "Return to the group commander" task being completed immediately after being assigned each time the player receives it after initially completing it. - Decane
- Fixed Freedom's "Eliminate the potential threat at the gas station" task being cancelled when the player completes its objective. - Decane
- Fixed the issue where submitting the item requested in a 'return item' task would not complete the task if the player possesses multiple units of the item when submitting it. - Decane
- Fixed the Red Forest bridge lowering sequence becoming prematurely unlocked as soon as the player completes the "Go to the army base" task rather than only after the player has transmitted the coordinates to free Leshiy's squad from the space bubble. - Decane
- Fixed the exploit where the player could repeatedly break the Compass artifact submission dialog and re-enter it to receive the reward (a Vintar BC) again and again an endless amount of times. - Decane
- Fixed the issue where the dialog concerning the military presence at the Cordon vehicle station could be repeated endlessly with the stalker squad on the hill overlooking it, potentially leading to the player paying the stalker squad multiple times for their assistance in dealing with the military. - Decane
- Fixed the "Life support system" upgrade for the Freedom Exoskeleton making the player bleed out faster rather than slower as intended. - Talrivian
- Fixed the "Relief backpack" upgrade for various armors wrongly incrementing the carry weight tooltip value by only 5kg instead of the 15kg actually unlocked by the upgrade. - vlad54rus
- Fixed the upgrades unlocked by the "Flash drive with data on a psy-protection system" and the "Flash drive with data on reinforced army body armor" being swapped for the SEVA suit at the Garbage bandit mechanic. - Decane
- Fixed the "Barrel modification" and "Gas system modification" upgrades for the RP-74 at the Agroprom Duty mechanic incorrectly being unlocked by the "Flash drive with data on balancing the automated parts of a machine gun" instead of by the "Flash drive with data on a machine gun muzzle break" and the "Flash drive with data on modifying the gas exhaust of a machine gun", respectively. - Decane
- Added the missing 'doesn't use shot' attribute text to the "Barrel modification" upgrade tooltip for the Chaser 13. - Decane
- Added the missing '+15%' handling attribute quantifier text to the "Barrel modification" upgrade tooltip for the Akm 74/2U. - SetaKat
- Fixed mutants not behaving aggressively on patrol paths linking them to attack-targets unless aggravated by an external force (e.g. the player). - Decane
- Fixed a script typo preventing the Lost Party's PDA from being transferred to Sakharov upon talking to him following completion of the task to retrieve it. - Decane
- Fixed the audio of an NPC's instrument-playing animation continuing to play even when the animation is interrupted by the NPC getting up intermittently. - Decane
- Fixed faction reward tooltips failing to update to reflect new rewards after resuming progress from a savegame in which the player already has an outstanding reward from the relevant faction. - Decane
- Fixed the mechanic specialization tooltip displaying 'none' for Aydar, Yar, and Thunderov, despite all of them having a specialization. - Decane
